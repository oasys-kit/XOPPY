==================================   Wiggler Radiation       =================

Wiggler Radiation calculates the emission (flux) and power of a wiggler versus
photon energy and X and Y coordinates at a given screen.

The application deals with conventional (sinusoidal) wigglers, wigglers (or short IDs)
with magnetic field from a file, and bending magnets (which are treated as a wiggler
with constant magnetic field).

The wiggler emission can cropped and further propagated using XOPPY/Power3D.

The algorithm is based on the following ideas:

1) calculate the electron transversal velocity from the integral of the magnetic field
   versus the s coordinate (along the ring).
   This velocity gives the horizontal divergence divergence of the emission generated
   at that particular s point.

2) Calculate the corresponding emission intensity for each photon energy Ephoton, which is
   proportional srfunc.sync_g1(Ephoton/Ec). Interpolate it to a uniform grid in divergence (H).

3) Calculate the vertical divergence profile given by srfunc.sync_ang(Ephoton/Ec).

4) Convolve (if wanted) the horizontal divergence with the vertical divergence to get a new
   horizontal divergence without edge effects.

5) Calculate for each photon energy the intensity of the emission by doing the outer product
   of the horizontal by the vertical divergences. Normalize it to one.

6) Multiply the maps from 5) by the distance and by the integrated flux at each photon energy
   to get the illumination on the slit.

Note that:

1) The storage ring emittance is not used. It is supposed that its effect is negliageble
  as compared with the wiggler emission.

2) The calculation use the spectrum totally integrated (full emission from
  srfunc.wiggler_spectrum) therefore the window has to accept all the radiation. The
  window is calculated automatically, therefore there is no user control on that. If one
  wants to calculate the power in a given slit, then use Power3D to crop the generated radiation.
